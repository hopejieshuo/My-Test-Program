# BezierIcon
This is a program to draw icons on a bezier curve track.  
I referred to some information on the Internet and also completed the effect based on my own experience.  
However, the effect I produced doesn't seem to work very well because its first point is always in the upper left corner of the screen.  
I hope someone can improve this program so that it can accomplish diverse effects.
