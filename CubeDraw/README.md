# CubeDraw
This is a 3D cube effect I recently created.  
Unfortunately, my production process was too rough and the effect can only be rendered on a black background.  
You can head over to my X to [see my process](https://twitter.com/hopeful8192/status/1807325743669461054?s=19).  
## WARNING
I didn't reference any malware or use ChatGPT, I made it with reference to Microsoft's publicly available Win32 API documentation as well as my own manuscript!
